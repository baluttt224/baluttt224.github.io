            <h4>About my Time as an Intern for TCMC:</h4>
            <p>I was a Web Design Intern for TCMC during the summer of 2020.  During my intership, I was tasked with creating and adding a News Release page to the TCMC website. I learned many beneficial things during my internship. The internship allowed me to learn how to write a project proposal, explore web design, gain experience using the program Elementor and acquire a better understanding of how businesses function and manage funding.  While working as an intern for TCMC, I learned the importance of knowing one’s worth. I now have a greater amount of confidence in my work and understand the value of having a ‘go-getter’ attitude in one’s career. This was my first internship and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity during these challenging times.</p>

            <h2>Magic Square Project</h2>
            <h3>CISC 131</h3>
            <p> This project asks the users for an odd integer greater than two.  If the number entered fits the criteria, the program creates a magic square according to the user's specified height and width.  As defined by Wikipedia, "In recreational mathematics, a magic square is an array of distinct positive integers such that the sums of the integers in each row, column and main diagonal are equal. The integer is the order of the magic square and the constant sum is called the magic constant."</p>
