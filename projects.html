            <h4>About my Time as an Intern at TCMC:</h4>
            <p>I was a Web Design Intern for TCMC during the summer of 2020.  During my intership, I was tasked with creating and adding a News Release page to the TCMC website. I learned many beneficial things during my internship. The internship allowed me to learn how to write a project proposal, explore web design, gain experience using the program Elementor and acquire a better understanding of how businesses function and manage funding.  While working as an intern for TCMC, I learned the importance of knowing one’s worth. I now have a greater amount of confidence in my work and understand the value of having a ‘go-getter’ attitude in one’s career. This was my first internship and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity during these challenging times.</p>
